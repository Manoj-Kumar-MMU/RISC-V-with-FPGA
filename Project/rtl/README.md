## Hardware RTL Sources

- [`core`](https://github.com/stnolting/neorv32/tree/main/rtl/core):
This folder contains the core VHDL files for the NEORV32 CPU and the NEORV32 Processor.
When creating a new synthesis/simulation project make sure that all `*.vhd` files from this
folder are added to a **new design library** called `neorv32`. The processor's top entity
is [`neorv32_top.vhd`](https://github.com/stnolting/neorv32/blob/main/rtl/core/neorv32_top.vhd).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The sub-folder [`core/mem`](https://github.com/stnolting/neorv32/tree/main/rtl/core/mem)
contains the _platform-agnostic_ VHDL architectures of the processor-internal memories (IMEM & DMEM).
Make sure to add _one_ of these modules for each memory to the project's HDL file list. These default
files can also be replaced by optimized platform-specific memory modules.

- [`processor_templates`](https://github.com/stnolting/neorv32/tree/main/rtl/processor_templates):
Contains pre-configured "SoC" templates that instantiate the processor's top entity from `core`.
These templates can be instantiated directly within a FPGA-specific board wrapper.

- [`system_integration`](https://github.com/stnolting/neorv32/tree/main/rtl/system_integration):
Top entities in this folder provide the same peripheral/IO signals and configuration generics as
the default processor top entity from `core`, but featuring a different interface.

- [`test_setups`](https://github.com/stnolting/neorv32/tree/main/rtl/test_setups):
Minimal processor test setups (FPGA- and board-independent. See the folder's README
for more information. Note that these test setups are used in the
[NEORV32 User Guide](https://stnolting.github.io/neorv32/ug).
